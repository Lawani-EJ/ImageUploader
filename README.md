## Implementation Details
### `core.ts`
Defines the UploadThing file router with middleware for authentication and file upload constraints.

### `route.ts`
Creates API route handlers using UploadThingâ€™s `createRouteHandler()` function.

### `image-upload.tsx`
A React component that utilizes the `UploadButton` from UploadThing to provide a user-friendly upload interface.

### `layout.tsx`
Sets up global styles and includes UploadThing's styles.

### `page.tsx`
Renders the `ImageUpload` component within a styled page.

## Usage
- Click the **Upload** button to select an image.
- The middleware ensures the user is authenticated before uploading.
- Uploaded files are logged in the console with metadata.
